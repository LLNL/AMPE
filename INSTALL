Step 0: Build any necessary third-party library as needed

AMPE requires the third-party packages hypre, Sundials and SAMRAI. These
libaries are typically not pre-installed on most systems and need to be
installed.

SAMRAI: compatible with version 4.0.0 or later, built without Sundials.
Sundials: compatible with version 5.4.0 or later.

To build SAMRAI4.0.0, do something similar to this:
--------------------------------------------------

Download SAMRAI release from
https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/samrai/software#download
(includes BLT)

gunzip  SAMRAI-v4.0.0.tar.gz
cat SAMRAI-v4.0.0.tar|tar -xpf -
mv SAMRAI SAMRAI-v4.0.0

cd SAMRAI-v4.0.0
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpiCC -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpif77 \
      -DHDF5_DIR=$HDF5_DIR -DHYPRE_DIR=$HOME/hypre/gnu-cpu \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/q8j/SAMRAI/SAMRAI-v4.0.0 ..

make
make install

Step 1: Build the AMPE code with cmake

mkdir build
cd build

From the build directory, run a "cmake script". For example on syrah:

../scripts/peloton_cmake

where the solver dimension is specified (2d or 3d).
If a script does not exist for the platform-compiler_optimization
combination you want, you'll have to create your own using one of the
existing "cmake" scripts as an example.
Note that the option "-DUSE_CVODE=ON" is required for that build to work.

Then run:
   make

It will create the main executable build/source/ampe2d (or ampe3d) as well
as executable unit tests.

To run the test suite, run:
   make test
