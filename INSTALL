Step 0: Build any necessary third-party library as needed

AMPE requires the third-party packages hypre and SAMRAI. These libaries
are typically not pre-installed on most systems and need to be installed.
SAMRAI: compatible with version 4.0.0 or later, built without Sundials.

To build SAMRAI4.0.0, do something similar to this:
--------------------------------------------------

Download SAMRAI release from
https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/samrai/software#download
(includes BLT)

gunzip  SAMRAI-v4.0.0.tar.gz
cat SAMRAI-v4.0.0.tar|tar -xpf -
mv SAMRAI SAMRAI-v4.0.0

cd SAMRAI-v4.0.0
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpiCC -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpif77 \
      -DHDF5_DIR=$HDF5_DIR -DHYPRE_DIR=$HOME/hypre/gnu-cpu \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/q8j/SAMRAI/SAMRAI-v4.0.0 ..

make
make install

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Step 1:
Run autoconf:

   autoconf

This should generate the 'configure' file

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Step 2: Configure for a specific combination of platform, compiler and
        optimization level

After checking out from the repository, cd into the top level
directory and execute the configure script for the
platform-compiler-optimization you want to build.  For example, to
configure for syrah (LLNL) using the Intel C++ and Fortran compilers with
optimization, execute

   scripts/doconfig_peloton_icpc_ifort_opt

If a script does not exist for the platform-compiler_optimization
combination you want, you'll have to create your own using one of the
existing scripts as an example.  Note that all of the scripts
currently in the "scripts" subdirectory assume that they are being
executed from the top level directory (as indicated above), which is
the location of of the configure script the "doconfig" scripts depend
upon.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Step 3: Install the base (i.e., third-party) libraries for the
        new platform-compiler-optimization combination

The configuration step just performed will create a subdirectory
"build" of the top level directory (if it didn't already exist) and a
subdirectory of the "build" directory labeled by the associated
platform-compiler-optimization combination.  Underneath that
subdirectory are three more subdirectories: base, config, and objects.
In other words, for the current example, the following directory tree
is created if ruuning the script on syrah:

(top level directory)
          |
          |
        build
          |
          |
  syrah-mpic++-mpif77-opt
    |     |      |
    |     |      |
  base  config  objects

To install the base libraries, cd into the base subdirectory and
execute the doinstall script located there:

  cd build/syrah-mpic++-mpif77-opt/base
  ./doinstall

This will compile and install the base libraries, which currently
consist of Sundials (including CPODES).

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Step 4: Build the AMPE code with cmake

From the build directory, run a "cmake script". For example on syrah:

   ../scripts/peloton_cmake

where the solver dimension is specified (2d or 3d).
If a script does not exist for the platform-compiler_optimization
combination you want, you'll have to create your own using one of the
existing "cmake" scripts as an example.
Then run:
   make

It will create the main executable build/source/ampe2d (or ampe3d) as well
as executable unit tests.

To run the test suite, run:
   make test

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Miscellaneous notes:

1. The configuration performed in Step 1 generates the Makefile in
build/syrah-mpic++-mpif77-opt/objects from the template Makefile.in in
source.  This includes the generation of the file Makefile.depend in
source, which describes the build dependencies.  This means that if
any changes are made to the source code that could affect the
dependencies, the configuration step should be redone.

2. For the "CVODE" build (no projections, not quaternions propagation),
one should link with an external (Sundials v3.0.0 or later) using cmake
options like: 
-DUSE_CVODE=ON -DSUNDIALS_DIR=$HOME/sundials/sundials-3.0.0/install
