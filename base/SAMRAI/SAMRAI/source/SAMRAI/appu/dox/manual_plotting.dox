  @page package_apputils_plotting Visualization Data File Generation

  These classes provide basic support to generate data files that may
  be post-processed using the Vizamrai or Visit visualization tool.  Two kinds
  of data quantities are supported, those that reside on an AMR patch
  hierarchy when a data file is created, and those that are "derived" from 
  data living on an AMR patch hierarchy.

  The Vizamrai writer supports cartesian cell-centered data only, while 
  the Visit writer supports cell, node, and logically-mapped (e.g. ALE)
  data.    In addition, the VisIt writer supports material-related data
  and ghost zone data.
