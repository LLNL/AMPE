#########################################################################

This example demonstrates use of simple boundary utilities to implement
and test basic boundary conditions in a SAMRAI application. 
The files included in this directory are as follows:
 
          main.C                      -  example main program
          BoundaryDataTester.[Ch]     -  example user routines for boundary data
          sample_input/*.input        -  various 2d and 3d input files
 
COMPILE and RUN
---------------
Compile:  make main*d  to build the *d version of the example
Run:      main*d sample_input/*.input

Results will be reported in a log file whose name corresponds to the 
given input file; i.e., main*d sample_input/*.input produces a log
file named *.log.
 

INPUTS:
------------
  
Each input file contains 3 sections used to describe the test and to
initialize the various object involved inthe test.

The "Main" section includes the log file name, and describes how the 
domain should be chopped into patches when it is a parallelepiped
(in 3d or a rectangle in 2d).  For example in 2d this might look like:

Main {
    log_file_name    = "basic2d-flow.log"
    num_domain_boxes = 2 , 1
}

The "CartesianGridGeometry" section describes the physical coordinates
of the domain and the periodic directions (if any).  For example in 2d 
this might look like: 
 
CartesianGridGeometry {
   domain_boxes = [ (0,0) , (7,3) ]
   x_lo         = 0.e0 , 0.e0   // lower end of computational domain.
   x_up         = 1.e0 , 0.5e0   // upper end of computational domain.
   periodic_dimension = 0, 0
}

The "BoundaryDataTester" section describes the variables and their
attributes in the test problem.  Applicable boundary information is
described in a subdatabase called "Boundary_data".  For example in 2d  
this might look like:
 
BoundaryDataTester {

   //
   // Variable information is read in by the BoundaryDataTester object
   // Each variable has its own sub-database which must contain the proper
   // variable information.  The name of each sub-database for a variable
   // is arbitrary.  But the names must be distinct.  Also the names of the
   // individual variables must be distinct.
   //
   //    Required input:  name
   //                     interior_values    (# of values must = depth)
   //    Optional input:  depth              (default = 1)
   //                     num_ghosts         (default = 1,1)
   //
 
   variable_1 {
      name            = "var1"
      depth           = 1
      num_ghosts      = 2 , 2
      interior_values = 1.0
   }
 
   variable_2 {
      name            = "var2"
      depth           = 2
      num_ghosts      = 1 , 1
      interior_values = 2.0 , 3.0
   }

   //
   // Boundary conditioninformation is read in by the BoundaryDataTester object
   // Each boundary type and location has its own sub-database which must be
   // named properly and contain valid boundary information.
   //
   // Valid boundary_condition entries for edges in 2d are:
   //     "FLOW", "SYMMETRIC", "DIRICHLET"
   //
   // Valid boundary_condition entries for nodes in 2d are:
   //     "*FLOW", "*SYMMETRIC", "*DIRICHLET"
   // Here, "*" may be either "X" or "Y".  The condition given for a node
   // must match that of the appropriate adjacent edge.  This is enforced
   // for consistency.  Note that when a REFLECT edge condition is given
   // and the other adjacent edge has either a FLOW or REFLECT condition,
   // the resulting node boundary values will be the same regardless of
   // which edge is used.
   //
   // Boundary data must be given for each edge and node in a non-periodic
   // direction.  Any input values given for periodic directions will be ignored.
   //
   //
   Boundary_data {

      // see the various sample input files for more details....
