This test case tests the functionality of the timer and statistician
classes in SAMRAI.

Compilation: 
             make                     
             make timertest (generates timer_test)
             make statstest (generates stats_test)

Execution:   
             serial               - ./timer_test input.file
             serial (restarted)   - ./timer_test input.file restart 0 1
             parallel             - mpirun -np <procs> [necessary options] [above serial cmd]

             The necessary options are those required by MPI to run the
             executable.  For example, on the CASC Sun Cluster, one needs
             to specify the machines that will run the MPI processes in
             a file and use the -machinefile <filename> option.

timer_test: (What it does)

             This test will measure the time per call to invoke timers in your code.
             To run, set the following two variables in the input file:
                	ntimes - number of times timer is called
                        exclusive_tree_depth - depth of exclusive timers

             Run #1:                           Run #2:
		print_exclusive  = FALSE           = TRUE
                print_concurrent = FALSE           = TRUE
             Output to log file will show wallclock time for the calls.  Time per call
             is computed as follows:
        
             unregistered timer = wall time for apps::main::timer_off/ntimes
             registered timer =  Run #1: wall time for apps:main:timer_on/ntimes
             exclusive timer =   Run #2: wall time for apps::main:exclusive_timer/
                                              (ntimes*exclusive_tree_depth)

             The following are results measured on some systems we support,
             with ntimes = 1000, exclusive_timer_depth = 5.

stats_test:
            Mimics an actual time dependent integration loop by building a  
            statistician object that records current simulation time and some
            dummy integer value (e.g. could be gridpoints).  Outputs this to
            log file at the end.
