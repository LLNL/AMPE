  // boundary slope, "value" means boundary value, and "coefficients"

  // The remaining strings are converted into numbers as
  // appropriate for what boundary condition you specified with
  // the first string.  Other boundary conditions are possible.
  // see the solv_RobinBcCoefStrategy class.
